This site provides an overview of my GitHub projects and reverse engineering crackmes. My projects are primarily educational, focused on learning and experimentation rather than fully polished applications or libraries. They also serve as a good starting point for anyone looking to explore the concepts further or build their own projects.

In addition, the blog features community-contributed solutions to crackmes, showcasing different approaches and techniques for solving each challenge. The goal is to create a space where you can explore, learn, and understand reverse engineering and programming from multiple perspectives.
